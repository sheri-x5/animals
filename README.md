[Dog Diarrhea](https://animaliaplanet.com/when-is-dog-diarrhea-an-emergency/) that lasts longer than 24 hours is very concerning and may be an emergency. If your dog has no other symptoms, you may be able to see your regular vet for long-lasting diarrhea. However, if the regular vet is unavailable or your dog shows other symptoms of an issue, go to the emergency vet instead.
